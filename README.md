# Tag My Outfit - Client Interface

## Overview

This project defines a client package to facilitate the communication with a server that implements this [gRPC interface](https://github.com/DuarteMRAlves/tag_my_outfit_interface).
It aims to provide a object oriented interface which hides the client side gRPC communication details. 

The code was developed and tested in coordination with the [Tag My Outfit server](https://github.com/DuarteMRAlves/tag_my_outfit_server), which implements the server side of the previously mentioned interface.
